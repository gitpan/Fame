fameperl

1.0  8/93 Public Domain

The first vesion was developed for perl 4.036 at the Federal Reserve to 
facilitate importing data into FAME and extracting data.  Implemented 
most C HLI functions.  The code was written using the h2c and h2i 
programs and a modified version of "mus".

1.1  Public Domain

Modified utilities to handle missing values and sometimes strings.  
Changed source code to use "cliperl" so that most of the same source code
can be used for perl and tcl.

1.2  12/94 Public Domain

Ported to perl 5.000 and added support for FAME 7.5.  Last public
domain version available from the Federal Reserve.  Probably very
buggy and hardly used at all.

2.0  9/95

Ported to perl5.001.  Added object-oriented utilitites and a 
TIEHASH interface.  Wrote "pod" documentation.

2.0a  9/95

Bug fixes.  Reorganized Fame package into two packages: 
Fame::HLI, Fame::DB.  Added Fame::LANG package.

10/2/95  First alpha distribution.
10/4/95  Change syntax of Fame::DB::new to be just like TIEHASH.
11/15/95 Add general support for DATE values in HLI utilities.
         Fix cfmdati bug (make datstr output).
5/7/96   Clean up fame.c.
6/27/96  Remove autosplit support and make other changes
         to the make process so it works with perl5.003.
